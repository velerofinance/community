## [Executive Vote] Collateral Onboarding - December 6, 2021

The Governance Facilitator(s) and the VeleroDAO have placed an Executive Vote into the voting system. VDGT Holders should vote for this proposal if they support the following alterations to the VeeroFinance.

### Onboard WAG as a new Collateral Type

A new collateral type, WAG, will be added to the Velero if this proposal passes. WAG will be added with the following parameters in the WAG-A vault type.

* Stability Fee: 6%
* Liquidation Ratio: 160%
* Debt Ceiling: 3 million USDV
* Auction Lot Size: 50,000 USDV
* Minimum Bid Increment: 3%
* Bid Duration: 140 minutes
* Max Auction Duration: 140 minutes
* Liquidation Penalty: 13%
* Dust: 500 USDV

Please review the following forum threads containing information about WAG to inform your position before voting.
* Initial Collateral Application
* Risk Evaluation
* Smart Contracts Evaluation
* Oracles Evaluation

## Summary

Therefore, if this Executive proposal passes the following will occur:

**Collateral Onboarding**
* The WAG-A vault type will be added using WAG as collateral with the parameters listed above.

**Other**
This Executive Vote will continue until the number of votes in favor surpasses the votes in favor of the currently leading proposal. This is a continuous approval vote. 

If this executive vote does not pass within 30 days then it will expire, and will have no effect on the VeleroFinance, even if it should later pass. 

Note that this proposal will include an office-hours modifier that means it can only be cast between 14:00 and 21:00 UTC, Monday - Friday. This is to ensure that at least some auction keepers are available to react to unforeseen issues with their bots in the event of early liquidations.

## Review

Community debate on these topics can be found on the VeleroDAO governance forum. Please review any linked threads to inform your position before voting.

Additionally, these changes may have been discussed further in recent Governance calls. Video for these calls is available to review.

## Action

**Voting for this proposal will place your VDGT in support of implementing the changes outlined above.**
