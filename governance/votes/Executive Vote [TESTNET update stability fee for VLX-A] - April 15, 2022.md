## [Executive Vote] Update stability FEE for VLX-A - April 15, 2022

## Summary

Therefore, if this Executive proposal passes the following will occur:

**Update stability FEE**
* To return USDV to the 1 USD exchange rate on Wagyu swap, it is temporarily necessary to raise the stability fee.
**Other**
This Executive Vote will continue until the number of votes in favor surpasses the votes in favor of the currently leading proposal. This is a continuous approval vote. 

If this executive vote does not pass within 30 days then it will expire, and will have no effect on the VeleroFinance, even if it should later pass. 

Note that this proposal will include an office-hours modifier that means it can only be cast between 14:00 and 21:00 UTC, Monday - Friday. This is to ensure that at least some auction keepers are available to react to unforeseen issues with their bots in the event of early liquidations.

## Review

Community debate on these topics can be found on the VeleroDAO governance forum. Please review any linked threads to inform your position before voting.

Additionally, these changes may have been discussed further in recent Governance calls. Video for these calls is available to review.

## Action

**Voting for this proposal will place your VDGT in support of implementing the changes outlined above.**
